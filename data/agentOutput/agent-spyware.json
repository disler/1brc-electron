The sample data output in the form of \"{station=mean/min/max}\" is not included, as per your requirement for the 'brc' table structure.\n\nMake sure that the 'measurements.txt' file is located in the appropriate directory where DuckDB can access it, and adjust the path in the READ_CSV function if necessary.",

    "message": "The DuckDB documentation appears not to include a subsection explicitly for pagination in the search results. However, pagination can be implemented in SQL by using the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses. With this approach, `LIMIT` constrains the number of rows returned by the query, and `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows. \n\nUsing these clauses, we can create a Typescript function that allows for paging through the results of the 'brc' table. Here is how you could implement such a function in Typescript, assuming there is a function `executeQuery` which sends a query to the DuckDB database and returns the results:\n\n```typescript\nimport { DuckDBClient } from './duckdb-client'; // Import a hypothetical asynchronous DuckDB client\n\nclass BrcTablePager {\n  private client: DuckDBClient;\n\n  constructor(duckDBClient: DuckDBClient) {\n    this.client = duckDBClient;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get a paginated list of rows from the 'brc' table.\n   * @param page The page number (0-indexed).\n   * @param size The number of items per page.\n   * @returns A promise that resolves to an array of 'brc' table rows.\n   */\n  public async getBrcPage(page: number, size: number): Promise<any[]> {\n    const offset = page * size;\n    const sql = `SELECT * FROM brc LIMIT ${size} OFFSET ${offset};`;\n    return await this.client.executeQuery(sql);\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n/*\nconst duckDBClient = new DuckDBClient({ host: 'localhost', port: 1234 });\nconst pager = new BrcTablePager(duckDBClient);\n\nconst page = 0; // first page\nconst size = 10; // 10 rows per page\n\npager.getBrcPage(page, size).then((rows) => {\n  console.log(rows);\n}).catch((error) => {\n  console.error('Error fetching page:', error);\n});\n*/\n```\nThis function `getBrcPage` takes a `page` and a `size` parameter and constructs a SQL query to retrieve the corresponding page of results from the 'brc' table. The actual database client to execute the query is an abstraction and would need to be implemented based on how you connect to DuckDB using Node.js or another environment that can execute Typescript code.",
